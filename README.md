# `gitz`

### ðŸš¨ `gitz` is not ready for serious use at this time ðŸš¨

`gitz` is currently under heavy development, don't use it for anything important.

gitz is a tool to sign a thing (script, file, etc) with using sigstore keyless 
signing and then store the signature, sigstore certicate in a git repository.

It neatly maps the script, signature and public key using the commit sha.

gitz will also perform a verification of the signature and public key against
the commit sha when running the `install` command.
